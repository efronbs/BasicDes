This is a simple DES implementation read from file desinput.txt, which much be in the format

# of iterations
# of rounds
64 bit input message in binary
64 bit key

All function prototypes and imports are stored in the file "des.h"
All constants (sboxes, bit permutations, etc.) are in the file "constants.h"
All code is in the file "fiestel.cpp". This is because I was originally going to split it up over multiple files, but when I tried to add the key generation file I realized I made the headers wrong, so I would have had to restructure my project for multiple files to work. Because I didn't want to spend the time doing that, all code in organized in fiestel.cpp

all of this code is located at github.com/efronbs
